ASIAN KUNG FU GENERATION WEBSTIE

I made this website based off a band called ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION, to serve as their main website to promote their music, socials, and videos. There are 5 parts, the homepage, the profile page talking about each band member (where they come from, where they lived, how they got together and fun trivia), their discography, live videos that they put online, and music videos they have released.

Design Process

my thought process was to make it so  that this can serve to promote the band as a whole, giving multiple sections to see the band in all its glory.

As a fan, I want to explore the band's music, so I can listen to their albums and songs.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
